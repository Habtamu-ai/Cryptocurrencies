# Cryptocurrencies
# Overview
The objective of this project is to identify the best cryptocurrrency in the market to invet on.The project is going to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

# Results
 - Total number of cryptos
 - The below table shows the available crryptos in the market.  We could find 1256 different kinds of cryptos. The data also contain different important informations, such as: 
 the coin name, the algorithm, if it is trading, the proof type, if the coin mined, and thee total supply of the coin.

- Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
Once after we discovered all the cryptos ou in the market we cleaned the data and organized it for analysis.
Then the project create the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm, and reduce the dimensions of the X DataFrame to three principal components and place these dimensions in a new DataFrame.

- Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
 The project uses the K-means algorithm to create an elbow curve using hvPlot to find the best value for K from the above principal component data frame. Then, we run the K-means algorithm to predict the K clusters for the cryptocurrenciesâ€™ data.
